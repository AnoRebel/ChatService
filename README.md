## Peep

This is a simple chat/conferencing service I made from different tutorials I was checking out.
Also, as a mini project for school, i tried it as first from this tutorial 
using <a href="https://www.okta.com">Okta</a> from this <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-video-chat-service-with-javascript-webrtc-and-okta">tutorial</a> but
the okta module has some issues setting up, so i settled up with <a href="https://www.auth0.com>Auth0</a> and worked it out, both okta and auth0 are authentication module, with free and paid versions. 
Ok, enough talk, lets get to the fun part.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AnoRebel/ChatService.git
```

```sh
cd ChatService
```

```sh
yarn install
```

```sh
yarn start
```
